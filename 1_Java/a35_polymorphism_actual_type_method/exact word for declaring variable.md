# Object hello = new String("asdf")
you are declaring a variable named hello of type Object and initializing it with a new instance of the String class.

The String instance is created with the value "asdf". Because String is a subclass of Object in Java, you can assign an instance of String to a variable of type Object. This is an example of polymorphism, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.

# another example
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

1. Declaring a variable named names of type List<String>.
2. Initializing names with a new instance of ArrayList<String>. 


We create a new ArrayList object and assigns it to the names variable, which is declared as a List<String>. 


In the line List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();, we are creating a new ArrayList object that can hold String objects and assigning it to a variable named names.

The List interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a way to store and manipulate a collection of objects. The ArrayList class is one implementation of the List interface that provides dynamic resizing and fast random access to elements.

By declaring the names variable as a List<String>, we are indicating that it can hold a collection of String objects. We then create a new ArrayList object using the ArrayList constructor with no arguments, which creates an empty list with an initial capacity of 10.

The diamond operator <> is used to indicate that the type of the ArrayList should be inferred from the type of the variable names. In this case, since names is declared as a List<String>, the ArrayList will also hold String objects.

Overall, this line of code creates a new ArrayList object that can hold String objects and assigns it to the names variable, which can be used to add, remove, and access elements in the list.

Programming to an interface:

In the line List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();, we declare the names variable as a List<String> instead of an ArrayList<String> because it is generally considered good practice to program to an interface rather than an implementation.

The List interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a way to store and manipulate a collection of objects. By declaring the names variable as a List<String>, we are indicating that it can hold a collection of String objects, but we are not specifying the implementation of the List interface.

This allows us to easily switch between different implementations of the List interface, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, or Vector, without changing the rest of the code that uses the List interface. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

In addition, programming to an interface promotes loose coupling between classes, which is a key principle of object-oriented programming. By depending on an interface rather than a specific implementation, classes can be more easily reused and tested in isolation.

Therefore, it is generally considered good practice to declare variables as interfaces rather than specific implementations whenever possible.
