GitHub Copilot: `PrintWriter` and `FileWriter` are both used for writing data to files, but there are some differences between them:

1. **Automatic flushing:** `PrintWriter` has an option for automatic flushing whenever a write operation is done. `FileWriter` does not have this feature.

2. **Methods for different data types:** `PrintWriter` has methods to print data of different types like integers, floats, strings, objects, etc. `FileWriter` is a character output stream that writes text to character files. It's more basic and only has methods to write characters or strings.

3. **Error handling:** `PrintWriter` suppresses `IOExceptions`. You won't get an `IOException` while using a `PrintWriter` unless you check for it explicitly using `checkError()`. On the other hand, `FileWriter` throws `IOException` which you need to handle.

4. **Performance:** `PrintWriter` can be slower than `FileWriter` because it needs to parse different types of data.

5. **Append:** `PrintWriter` can't append to an existing file.

In general, `PrintWriter` is more convenient to use when you need to write different types of data to a file, while `FileWriter` is a more basic class for writing characters to a file.


# so there is no way for printwriter to add to existing content without filewriter?


Correct, `PrintWriter` itself does not have a constructor or method that allows appending to an existing file. If you want to append to an existing file using `PrintWriter`, you need to wrap a `FileWriter` instance initialized in append mode. Here's how you can do it:

```java
try {
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("n70_write_to_file/file.txt", true));
    writer.println("Appended text");
    writer.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, the `PrintWriter` is constructed with a `FileWriter` that is set to append mode (`true`). This means that when you write to the file, the new text will be added at the end of the existing content, rather than replacing it.
