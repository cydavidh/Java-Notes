cydavidh: ```ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); ```Why don't we need `<String>` like for the ```new ArrayList<>()?

GitHub Copilot: In Java, starting from version 7, the diamond operator `<>` was introduced. This operator allows the compiler to infer the type arguments. This is known as type inference. 

When you create an instance of a generic class like `ArrayList`, you don't need to repeat the type argument on the right-hand side of the statement. The compiler can infer the type from the left-hand side of the statement. 

So, when you write `ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();`, the compiler understands that you want to create an `ArrayList` of `String` objects.

Here's the pseudocode for this:

```
1. Declare a variable of type ArrayList<String>
2. Instantiate a new ArrayList object using the diamond operator <>
3. The compiler infers the type argument from the left-hand side of the statement
4. Assign the new ArrayList object to the variable
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

Next, you might want to add some elements to your list, or perhaps remove or access elements.

cydavidh: /explain Syntax error, insert "VariableDeclarators" to complete LocalVariableDeclaration

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing typically means that you've started declaring a variable but haven't finished. In your code, on line 10, you're trying to access the `length` property of the `cars` array, but you're not doing anything with it. 

In Java, you can't just have an expression like `cars.length;` on its own. You either need to assign it to a variable, or use it in some other statement. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
int carsLength = cars.length; // Now you're storing the length of the array in a variable
```

Next, you might want to print out the length of the array, or use it in some calculations.

cydavidh: introduce me to sort of collections

GitHub Copilot: In Java, the `Collections` class provides several methods for manipulating collections. One of these methods is `sort()`, which is used to sort the elements of a list in ascending order.

Here's the pseudocode for using `Collections.sort()`:

```
1. Create a list of elements
2. Use Collections.sort() to sort the list
3. (Optional) Print the sorted list
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(5);
numbers.add(2);
numbers.add(8);
numbers.add(1);

Collections.sort(numbers);

System.out.println(numbers); // Outputs: [1, 2, 5, 8]
```

In the above code, we first create an `ArrayList` of integers. We then add some numbers to the list. After that, we use `Collections.sort()` to sort the numbers in ascending order. Finally, we print out the sorted list.

Next, you might want to try sorting a list of strings, or perhaps explore other methods provided by the `Collections` class.

cydavidh: and if it's a class we create, we can implement comparable interfece and compareTo method, this way we can use .sort, right?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. If you have a custom class and you want to sort its instances, you can have the class implement the `Comparable` interface and override the `compareTo()` method. This method defines the "natural ordering" of the objects.

Here's the pseudocode:

```
1. Define a custom class that implements the Comparable interface
2. Override the compareTo() method in the custom class
3. Create a list of instances of the custom class
4. Use Collections.sort() to sort the list
5. (Optional) Print the sorted list
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.name;
    }
}

ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
people.add(new Person("Charlie"));
people.add(new Person("Alice"));
people.add(new Person("Bob"));

Collections.sort(people);

System.out.println(people); // Outputs: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
```

In the above code, we define a `Person` class that implements `Comparable<Person>`. In the `compareTo()` method, we compare the `name` of the current `Person` with the `name` of another `Person`. We then create a list of `Person` objects and sort them using `Collections.sort()`. Finally, we print out the sorted list.

Next, you might want to try sorting on different properties of the `Person` class, or perhaps create a different custom class and sort its instances.

cydavidh: `array.length` why isn't length a method?

GitHub Copilot: In Java, `length` is a property of an array, not a method. This is because when an array is created, its size is fixed and cannot be changed. Therefore, `length` is a final instance variable available to arrays, and it represents the size of the array.

On the other hand, in classes like `String`, `ArrayList`, etc., `length()` or `size()` are methods because the length can change, and it needs to be computed each time you call the method.

Here's the pseudocode for accessing the length of an array:

```
1. Declare and initialize an array
2. Access the length property of the array
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int length = arr.length;
```

Next, you might want to use the length of the array to iterate over it, or perhaps use it in some calculations.

cydavidh: Let's create class List. The List has a generic array — the type of the elements in the array is defined on run time using type parameters. Let's set the size of the array to 10. The array is created as type object, and changed to type generic with `(Type[]) new Object[10];` — this is done because Java does not support the call `new Type[10];` for now.
```
public class List<Type> {
    private Type[] values;

    public List() {
        this.values = (Type[]) new Object[10];
    }
}
```
List encapsulates an array. In the beginning, every element in the array contains a null-reference.



Please explain why `new Type[10];` doesn't work, and what does list encapsulates an array mean.

GitHub Copilot: In Java, you cannot directly create an array of a generic type, like `new Type[10];`. This is because at runtime, Java needs to know the exact class of the array. However, due to type erasure, the exact class of `Type` is not known at runtime. Therefore, you have to create an array of `Object` and then cast it to `Type[]`.

The phrase "List encapsulates an array" means that the `List` class is a wrapper or container for an array. The array is a private member of the `List` class, and the class provides methods to interact with this array. This is a common design pattern in object-oriented programming, where a class is used to manage an underlying data structure and provide a higher-level interface to the user.

Here's the pseudocode for creating a generic `List` class:

```
1. Declare a class List with a generic type parameter Type
2. Declare a private member variable values of type array of Type
3. In the constructor of the class, initialize values as an array of Object with size 10, and cast it to Type[]
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
public class List<Type> {
    private Type[] values;

    public List() {
        this.values = (Type[]) new Object[10];
    }
}
```

Next, you might want to add methods to the `List` class to add, remove, or access elements in the `values` array.

cydavidh: can you explain more about the first paragraph of your last answer?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's break it down:

In Java, when you declare a generic type, like `Type` in your `List<Type>` class, the Java compiler replaces `Type` with its bound or `Object` if no bound is defined. This process is called type erasure. It's a mechanism that ensures backward compatibility and makes generics more secure.

However, due to type erasure, the runtime system has no way of knowing that `Type` was ever a part of the `List` class. As a result, you cannot directly create an array of `Type` because the runtime system doesn't know what `Type` is.

So, to get around this limitation, you create an array of `Object` (since all classes in Java inherit from `Object`), and then cast it to `Type[]`. This is what `(Type[]) new Object[10]` does.

This is a workaround and it's not type-safe because the Java compiler can't check if your `Object[]` is actually a `Type[]`. But as long as you only put `Type` instances into the array, you won't get a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

Next, you might want to add methods to your `List` class to manipulate the array, like adding, removing, or getting elements.

cydavidh: continuing from the previous questions and answers:
what does the list class look like after type erasure?

GitHub Copilot: After type erasure, the `List<Type>` class would look like this:

```java
public class List {
    private Object[] values;

    public List() {
        this.values = new Object[10];
    }
}
```

The generic type `Type` is replaced with `Object`, which is the upper bound of all classes in Java. This is because at runtime, due to type erasure, the JVM doesn't know about the generic type `Type`, so it replaces it with its upper bound, which is `Object` in this case.

Next, you might want to add methods to your `List` class to manipulate the array, like adding, removing, or getting elements.

cydavidh: what about the cast (Type[]) before new Object[10]

GitHub Copilot: The cast `(Type[])` in the original code is there to tell the compiler that the `Object[]` should be treated as `Type[]`. This is necessary because you can't directly create an array of a generic type in Java.

However, after type erasure, the generic type `Type` is replaced with `Object`, so the cast `(Type[])` is no longer necessary and is removed. The `Object[]` array is directly assigned to `values`.

So, in the original code:

```java
this.values = (Type[]) new Object[10];
```

After type erasure, it becomes:

```java
this.values = new Object[10];
```

Next, you might want to add methods to your `List` class to manipulate the array, like adding, removing, or getting elements.

cydavidh: what happens if we don't cast it and use the list class with some random type

GitHub Copilot: If you don't cast the `Object[]` to `Type[]` in the constructor of your `List` class, you'll get a compile-time error. This is because you're trying to assign an `Object[]` to a variable of type `Type[]`, which is not allowed without an explicit cast.

Here's the pseudocode for this:

```
1. Declare a class List with a generic type parameter Type
2. Declare a private member variable values of type array of Type
3. In the constructor of the class, try to initialize values as an array of Object with size 10, without casting it to Type[]
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
public class List<Type> {
    private Type[] values;

    public List() {
        this.values = new Object[10]; // This will cause a compile-time error
    }
}
```

If you try to compile this code, you'll get an error message like this:

```
error: incompatible types: Object[] cannot be converted to Type[]
        this.values = new Object[10];
                      ^
  where Type is a type-variable:
    Type extends Object declared in class List
1 error
```

This error message is telling you that you can't assign an `Object[]` to a `Type[]` without an explicit cast.

Next, you might want to fix this error by adding the cast `(Type[])`, or perhaps explore other ways to work with generic arrays in Java.

cydavidh: ```
public void remove(Type value) {
    int indexOfValue = indexOfValue(value);
    if (indexOfValue < 0) {
        return; // not found
    }

    moveToTheLeft(indexOfValue);
    this.firstFreeIndex--;
}
```
what does the `return;` do?

GitHub Copilot: The `return;` statement in this context is used to exit the method early. 

In your `remove(Type value)` method, you first find the index of the value you want to remove. If `indexOfValue(value)` returns a value less than 0, it means the value was not found in the list. 

In this case, the `return;` statement is executed, which immediately stops the execution of the rest of the method and returns control back to the caller. This is often referred to as an "early return" or "guard clause", and it's a common way to handle error conditions or special cases in a method.

Next, you might want to explore other methods in your `List` class, or perhaps learn about other control flow statements in Java.

cydavidh: how is it that we're adding `[]` after `List<Pair<K, V>>`? I thought my List.java 
```
package n76_implement_our_own_array_list_with_array;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class List<T> {
    private T[] values;
    private int firstFreeIndex;

    public List() {
        this.values = (T[]) new Object[10];
    }

    // public void grow1() {
    // T[] temp = (T[]) new Object[firstFreeIndex + firstFreeIndex / 2];
    // for (int i = 0; i < firstFreeIndex; i++) {
    // temp[i] = values[i];
    // }
    // this.values = temp;
    // }

    private void grow2() {
        this.values = Arrays.copyOf(this.values, this.values.length + this.values.length / 2);
    }

    public void add(T value) {
        if (firstFreeIndex == values.length) {
            grow2();
        }
        this.values[firstFreeIndex] = value;
        firstFreeIndex++;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return Arrays.toString(this.values);
    }

    public boolean contains(T value) {
        for (int i = 0; i < firstFreeIndex; i++) {
            if (this.values[i].equals(value)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public int findIndexOf(T value) {
        for (int i = 0; i < firstFreeIndex; i++) {
            if (this.values[i].equals(value)) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public void moveLeft(int fromIndex) {
        for (int i = fromIndex; i < firstFreeIndex; i++) {
            this.values[i] = this.values[i + 1];
        }
        firstFreeIndex--;
    }

    public void remove(T value) {
        int i = findIndexOf(value);
        if (i > -1) {
            moveLeft(i);
        }
    }

    public T findValueOf(int index) {
        return this.values[index];
    }

    public int size() {
        return firstFreeIndex;
    }

}

```
has arrays inside it?

GitHub Copilot: The `List<Pair<K, V>>[]` notation is used to declare an array of `List<Pair<K, V>>` objects. This is not related to the internal implementation of your `List` class.

In your `List` class, you're using an array to store the elements of the list internally. This is a common way to implement a list, but it's not related to the `List<Pair<K, V>>[]` notation.

The `List<Pair<K, V>>[]` notation is used when you want to create an array where each element is a `List<Pair<K, V>>`. This might be used, for example, in a hash table implementation where each bucket of the hash table is a list of key-value pairs.

Here's the pseudocode for creating an array of lists:

```
1. Declare an array of List<Pair<K, V>>
2. Initialize each element of the array as a new List<Pair<K, V>>
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
List<Pair<K, V>>[] array = new List[10];
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    array[i] = new List<Pair<K, V>>();
}
```

In the above code, we first create an array of `List<Pair<K, V>>`. We then initialize each element of the array as a new `List<Pair<K, V>>`.

Next, you might want to add elements to these lists, or perhaps use this array in a hash table implementation.

cydavidh: what is a Parameterized Types

GitHub Copilot: Parameterized types are a feature of generics in Java that allow you to specify the type of an object at the time of creation. This provides stronger type checks at compile time and eliminates the need for typecasting.

In the context of your `Box<T>` class, `T` is a type parameter that can be replaced with a real type when you create an instance of `Box`. This real type is called a type argument.

Here's the pseudocode for creating a parameterized type:

```
1. Declare a class with a type parameter T
2. Use T as a type in the class, for example as the type of a field
3. When creating an instance of the class, replace T with a real type
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) { this.t = t; }
    public T get() { return t; }
}

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
    }
}
```

In the above code, `Box<T>` is a parameterized type. When we create an instance of `Box` with `new Box<Integer>()`, we're replacing `T` with `Integer`. This means that `integerBox` is a `Box` that can only hold `Integer` objects.

Next, you might want to try using your `Box` class with different type arguments, or perhaps explore other features of generics in Java.

cydavidh: is List nongeneric and ArrayList generic?

GitHub Copilot: In Java, both `List` and `ArrayList` can be used with generics. 

`List` is an interface in Java and it can be parameterized with generics. For example, you can declare a `List` of `String` like this: `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();`.

`ArrayList` is a class in Java that implements the `List` interface. It also supports generics. For example, you can declare an `ArrayList` of `Integer` like this: `ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();`.

So, both `List` and `ArrayList` can be used as generic types in Java, allowing you to specify the type of elements they can contain at compile time.

Next, you might want to explore other collections in Java that support generics, like `Set` and `Map`, or perhaps learn about the differences between `List` and `ArrayList`.

cydavidh: Type Erasure
In  “Default  Methods”  on  page  158,  we  discussed  the  Java  platform’s  strong  prefer‐
ence  for  backward  compatibility.  The  addition  of  generics  in  Java  5  was  another
example of where backward compatibility was an issue for a new language feature.
The central question was how to make a type system that allowed older, nongeneric
collection  classes  to  be  used  alongside  with  newer,  generic  collections.  The  design
decision was to achieve this by the use of casts:
```
List someThings = getSomeThings();
// Unsafe cast, but we know that the
// contents of someThings are really strings
List<String> myStrings = (List<String>)someThings;
```
This  means  that  List  and  List<String>  are  compatible  as  types,  at  least  at  some
level.  Java  achieves  this  compatibility  by  type  erasure.  This  means  that  generic  type
parameters are only visible at compile time—they are stripped out by javac and are
not reflected in the bytecode.
The nongeneric type List is usually called a raw type. It is still
perfectly  legal  Java  to  work  with  the  raw  form  of  types,  even
for types that are now generic. This is almost always a sign of
poor-quality code, however.
The  mechanism  of  type  erasure  gives  rise  to  a  difference  in  the  type  system  seen
by  javac  and  that  seen  by  the  JVM—we  will  discuss  this  fully  in  “Compile  and
Runtime Typing” on page 174.
Type  erasure  also  prohibits  some  other  definitions,  which  would  otherwise  seem
legal.  In  this  code,  we  want  to  count  the  orders  as  represented  in  two  slightly
different data structures:
```
// Won't compile
interface OrderCounter {
  // Name maps to list of order numbers
  int totalOrders(Map<String, List<String>> orders);
  // Name maps to total orders made so far
  int totalOrders(Map<String, Integer> orders);
}
```
This  seems  like  perfectly  legal  Java  code,  but  it  will  not  compile.  The  issue  is
that  although  the  two  methods  seem  like  normal  overloads,  after  type  erasure,  the
signature of both methods becomes:
```
  int totalOrders(Map);
  ```
All  that  is  left  after  type  erasure  is  the  raw  type  of  the  container—in  this  case,  Map.
The runtime would be unable to distinguish between the methods by signature, and
so the language specification makes this syntax illegal.


please read the above and answer some of my questions next.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I'd be happy to help answer your questions about type erasure in Java. Please go ahead and ask your questions.

cydavidh: what is nongeneric type List?

GitHub Copilot: A non-generic `List` in Java is a list that can hold any type of object. It does not have a specific type parameter. Here's an example:

```java
List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("Hello");
list.add(123);
list.add(new Object());
```

In this example, `list` is a non-generic `List`. You can add any type of object to it: a `String`, an `Integer`, or any other object.

However, using non-generic lists is not recommended because they do not provide type safety. If you try to get an element from the list and assign it to a variable of a certain type, you'll need to cast it to that type, and if the element is not of that type, you'll get a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

For example, if you try to get the second element from the above list and assign it to a `String` variable, you'll get a `ClassCastException`:

```java
String str = (String) list.get(1); // Throws ClassCastException
```

This is why it's recommended to always use generic lists in Java, as they provide compile-time type safety and eliminate the need for casting.

cydavidh: can array be generic?

GitHub Copilot: In Java, you cannot directly create arrays of generic types due to type erasure. For example, the following code will not compile:

```java
T[] array = new T[10]; // This will not compile
```

However, you can create an array of `Object` and cast it to the generic type, like this:

```java
public class List<T> {
    private T[] values;

    public List() {
        this.values = (T[]) new Object[10];
    }
}
```

In this code, we're creating an array of `Object` and casting it to `T[]`. This will give a warning about unchecked cast, because the runtime type of the array is not `T[]`, it's `Object[]`. But as long as you only put `T` instances into the array, you won't get a `ClassCastException` when you get elements out of the array.

Next, you might want to explore other ways to work with generic arrays in Java, or perhaps learn about why direct creation of arrays of generic types is not allowed.

cydavidh: but you can with list?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, with `List` in Java, you can specify a type when creating an instance of it. This is because `List` is an interface that supports generics. Here's an example:

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

In this example, `List<String>` is a parameterized type. `String` is the type argument that replaces the type parameter `E` in the `List<E>` interface.

However, you cannot create an array of a generic type directly, as I mentioned in the previous response. This is a limitation of arrays in Java, not of generics.

Next, you might want to explore other collections in Java that support generics, like `Set` and `Map`, or perhaps learn more about the differences between arrays and collections in Java.

cydavidh: I don't understand why type erasure dictates that array cannot be generic and list can be generic

GitHub Copilot: Type erasure and the difference between arrays and generics in Java are two separate concepts.

Type erasure is a process applied by the Java compiler to ensure backward compatibility with Java versions that do not support generics. During this process, the compiler removes all type parameters and replaces them with their bounds or with `Object` if the type parameters are unbounded. The bytecode does not contain any information about the generic type parameters. This is why you cannot check the type of a generic parameter at runtime.

Arrays in Java are covariant and reified. This means that they preserve the type of their elements at runtime. For example, if you have an `Integer[]`, at runtime the JVM knows that this array can only contain `Integer` objects.

Generics, on the other hand, were implemented in a way that they are invariant and non-reified. This means that they do not preserve the type of their elements at runtime due to type erasure. For example, if you have a `List<Integer>`, at runtime the JVM only sees a raw `List`.

Because of these differences, you cannot create arrays of parameterized types. If you could, it would violate the type safety feature of generics.

For example, consider the following code:

```java
List<Integer>[] arrayOfLists = new List<Integer>[10]; // This is not allowed
```

If this were allowed, you could do the following:

```java
Object[] objectArray = arrayOfLists; // List<Integer>[] is a subtype of Object[]
objectArray[0] = Arrays.asList("Hello"); // This should not be allowed
Integer number = arrayOfLists[0].get(0); // This would throw a ClassCastException
```

In the above code, we're trying to put a `List<String>` into an array that should only contain `List<Integer>`. This would be allowed because at runtime, the JVM only sees a raw `List` due to type erasure. But when we try to get an element from the list and assign it to an `Integer`, we get a `ClassCastException`.

This is why you cannot create arrays of parameterized types in Java. It's not directly related to type erasure, but rather to the way arrays and generics were designed to work in Java.

Next, you might want to explore other features of generics in Java, or perhaps learn more about the differences between arrays and generics.

cydavidh: `int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
same format as above, create an example of List[].

GitHub Copilot: Here's an example of creating an array of `List<Integer>`:

```java
List<Integer>[] listOfArrays = new List[5];
for (int i = 0; i < listOfArrays.length; i++) {
    listOfArrays[i] = new ArrayList<>();
}
// At this point, listOfArrays is an array where each element is an empty List<Integer>
```

Please note that you cannot directly create an array of a parameterized type (`new List<Integer>[5]`), but you can create an array of the raw type (`new List[5]`) and then put `List<Integer>` instances into it. This will give a warning about unchecked assignment, because the runtime type of the array is not `List<Integer>[]`, it's `List[]`. But as long as you only put `List<Integer>` instances into the array, you won't get a `ClassCastException` when you get elements out of the array.

Next, you might want to add elements to these lists, or perhaps use this array in a more complex data structure.

cydavidh: i want the lists inside the array to have some number in it and I want to see the example for print array output.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can add numbers to each list in the array and then print the contents of the array. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer>[] listOfArrays = new List[5];
        for (int i = 0; i < listOfArrays.length; i++) {
            listOfArrays[i] = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(i, i+1, i+2));
        }

        // Print the contents of the array
        for (List<Integer> list : listOfArrays) {
            System.out.println(list);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we're creating an array of `List<Integer>`. For each list in the array, we're adding three numbers: `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`. Then, we're printing the contents of each list in the array.

When you run this code, you should see the following output:

```
[0, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
[3, 4, 5]
[4, 5, 6]
```

Each line in the output represents one list in the array.

Next, you might want to try modifying this code to add different numbers to the lists, or perhaps learn about other ways to print the contents of an array in Java.

cydavidh: following the last question, what is the output if we do Arrays.toString(listOfArrays) instead

GitHub Copilot: If you use `Arrays.toString(listOfArrays)`, it will print a string representation of the array, where each element is the result of calling `toString()` on the corresponding `List<Integer>`.

Here's the code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer>[] listOfArrays = new List[5];
        for (int i = 0; i < listOfArrays.length; i++) {
            listOfArrays[i] = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(i, i+1, i+2));
        }

        // Print the contents of the array using Arrays.toString()
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(listOfArrays));
    }
}
```

When you run this code, you should see the following output:

```
[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6]]
```

This output is a single string that represents the entire array. Each `[...]` inside the outer `[...]` represents one `List<Integer>` in the array.

Next, you might want to try modifying this code to add different numbers to the lists, or perhaps learn about other ways to print the contents of an array in Java.

cydavidh: can you create a list of lists of parameterized types?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can create a `List` of `List`s of parameterized types in Java. Here's an example:

```java
List<List<Integer>> listOfLists = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    listOfLists.add(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(i, i+1, i+2)));
}

// Print the contents of the list of lists
for (List<Integer> list : listOfLists) {
    System.out.println(list);
}
```

In this code, `listOfLists` is a `List` where each element is a `List<Integer>`. We're adding five lists to `listOfLists`, each containing three numbers. Then, we're printing the contents of each list in `listOfLists`.

When you run this code, you should see the following output:

```
[0, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
[3, 4, 5]
[4, 5, 6]
```

Each line in the output represents one `List<Integer>` in `listOfLists`.

Next, you might want to try modifying this code to add different numbers to the lists, or perhaps learn about other ways to work with lists of lists in Java.

cydavidh: can you create an array of parameterized types?

GitHub Copilot: No, you cannot create an array of parameterized types in Java due to how generics and arrays are implemented in the language.

Arrays in Java are covariant and reified, which means they know and enforce their element type at runtime. Generics, on the other hand, are implemented via type erasure, which means they only enforce their type constraints at compile time and discard (or "erase") the element type information at runtime.

Because of this, creating an array of a parameterized type would create a situation where the Java runtime system cannot correctly enforce the type constraint, leading to potential `ClassCastException`s that would not be caught at compile time.

For example, the following code does not compile:

```java
List<Integer>[] arrayOfLists = new List<Integer>[10]; // Compile-time error
```

Instead, you can create an array of the raw list type and cast it:

```java
List<Integer>[] arrayOfLists = (List<Integer>[]) new List[10]; // Unchecked warning
```

However, this will generate an unchecked warning, as the runtime type of the array is not `List<Integer>[]`, it's `List[]`.

Next, you might want to explore other ways to work with collections of parameterized types in Java, or perhaps learn more about the differences between arrays and generics.

cydavidh: can you create a list of parameterized types?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can create a `List` of parameterized types in Java. This is a common practice and one of the main uses of generics. Here's an example:

```java
List<String> listOfStrings = new ArrayList<>();
listOfStrings.add("Hello");
listOfStrings.add("World");

// Print the contents of the list
for (String str : listOfStrings) {
    System.out.println(str);
}
```

In this code, `listOfStrings` is a `List` where each element is a `String`. We're adding two strings to `listOfStrings`, and then printing the contents of the list.

When you run this code, you should see the following output:

```
Hello
World
```

Each line in the output represents one `String` in `listOfStrings`.

Next, you might want to try modifying this code to add different strings to the list, or perhaps learn about other ways to work with lists of parameterized types in Java.

cydavidh: why is it that we can create a list of parameterized types, but we cannot create an array of parameterized types?

GitHub Copilot: The difference between creating a `List` of parameterized types and an array of parameterized types in Java comes down to how generics (used in collections like `List`) and arrays are implemented in the language.

1. **Generics (like `List<T>`):** Generics in Java are a compile-time concept. The type parameter `T` is used to enforce type safety at compile time. Due to a feature called type erasure, the generic type information is removed when the code is compiled, and the compiled bytecode only sees raw types (like `List`, not `List<T>`). This allows generics to maintain backward compatibility with Java versions that do not support generics.

2. **Arrays:** Arrays in Java are covariant and reified. This means they carry their type information with them at runtime. For example, if you create an array of `Integer`, the JVM knows that this array can only contain `Integer` objects.

Because of these differences, you cannot create arrays of parameterized types. If you could, it would create a situation where the Java runtime system cannot correctly enforce the type constraint, leading to potential `ClassCastException`s that would not be caught at compile time.

For example, consider the following code:

```java
List<Integer>[] arrayOfLists = new List<Integer>[10]; // This is not allowed
```

If this were allowed, you could do the following:

```java
Object[] objectArray = arrayOfLists; // List<Integer>[] is a subtype of Object[]
objectArray[0] = Arrays.asList("Hello"); // This should not be allowed
Integer number = arrayOfLists[0].get(0); // This would throw a ClassCastException
```

In the above code, we're trying to put a `List<String>` into an array that should only contain `List<Integer>`. This would be allowed because at runtime, the JVM only sees a raw `List` due to type erasure. But when we try to get an element from the list and assign it to an `Integer`, we get a `ClassCastException`.

This is why you cannot create arrays of parameterized types in Java. It's not directly related to type erasure, but rather to the way arrays and generics were designed to work in Java.

Next, you might want to explore other features of generics in Java, or perhaps learn more about the differences between arrays and generics.

Replace the above example code with an arrayOfBoxes instead of arrayOfLists.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how the example would look if we used an array of `Box<T>` objects instead of `List<T>`:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t; // T stands for "Type"
    public void set(T t) { this.t = t; }
    public T get() { return t; }
}

// This would not be allowed
Box<Integer>[] arrayOfBoxes = new Box<Integer>[10]; 

// If it were allowed, you could do the following:
Object[] objectArray = arrayOfBoxes; // Box<Integer>[] is a subtype of Object[]
objectArray[0] = new Box<String>(); // This should not be allowed
Integer number = arrayOfBoxes[0].get(); // This would throw a ClassCastException
```

In the above code, we're trying to put a `Box<String>` into an array that should only contain `Box<Integer>`. This would be allowed because at runtime, the JVM only sees a raw `Box` due to type erasure. But when we try to get an element from the box and assign it to an `Integer`, we get a `ClassCastException`.

Next, you might want to explore other features of generics in Java, or perhaps learn more about the differences between arrays and generics.

cydavidh: so what must you do to create array of boxes

GitHub Copilot: To create an array of `Box` objects, you would need to create an array of the raw `Box` type and then cast it to `Box<T>[]`. However, this will generate an unchecked warning because the runtime type of the array is not `Box<T>[]`, it's `Box[]`.

Here's an example:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t; // T stands for "Type"
    public void set(T t) { this.t = t; }
    public T get() { return t; }
}

// Create an array of raw Box type and cast it to Box<Integer>[]
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
Box<Integer>[] arrayOfBoxes = (Box<Integer>[]) new Box[10];

// Now you can add Box<Integer> objects to the array
for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfBoxes.length; i++) {
    Box<Integer> box = new Box<>();
    box.set(i);
    arrayOfBoxes[i] = box;
}

// Print the contents of the array
for (Box<Integer> box : arrayOfBoxes) {
    System.out.println(box.get());
}
```

In this code, we're creating an array of `Box<Integer>` by creating an array of the raw `Box` type and casting it. We're adding a `Box<Integer>` to each element of the array, and then printing the contents of each box.

When you run this code, you should see the numbers 0 through 9 printed to the console, each on a new line.

Next, you might want to try modifying this code to add different numbers to the boxes, or perhaps learn about other ways to work with arrays of parameterized types in Java.

cydavidh: ```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t; // T stands for "Type"
    public void set(T t) { this.t = t; }
    public T get() { return t; }
}

// This would not be allowed
Box<Integer>[] arrayOfBoxes = new Box<Integer>[10]; 

// If it were allowed, you could do the following:
Object[] objectArray = arrayOfBoxes; // Box<Integer>[] is a subtype of Object[]
objectArray[0] = new Box<String>(); // This should not be allowed
Integer number = arrayOfBoxes[0].get(); // This would throw a ClassCastException
```


why doesn't arraylist have the same problem?

GitHub Copilot: `ArrayList` doesn't have the same problem because it's a generic class that internally uses an array of `Object` to store its elements. When you add an element to an `ArrayList`, it's stored as an `Object`, and when you retrieve an element, it's cast to the parameterized type `T`. This is safe because the type of elements that can be added to the `ArrayList` is controlled at compile time.

Here's a simplified version of what the `ArrayList` class does:

```java
public class ArrayList<T> {
    private Object[] elements;

    public ArrayList() {
        elements = new Object[10]; // Initial capacity
    }

    public void add(T t) {
        // Add the element as an Object
        elements[size] = t;
        size++;
    }

    public T get(int index) {
        // Retrieve the element and cast it to T
        return (T) elements[index];
    }
}
```

In this code, `elements` is an array of `Object`, so it can hold any type of object. When you add an element to the `ArrayList`, it's added to the `elements` array as an `Object`. When you retrieve an element, it's cast to the parameterized type `T`. This cast is safe because the type of elements that can be added to the `ArrayList` is controlled at compile time.

Next, you might want to explore the actual source code of the `ArrayList` class to see how it works in more detail, or perhaps learn about other ways to work with collections of parameterized types in Java.

cydavidh: ```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t; // T stands for "Type"
    public void set(T t) { this.t = t; }
    public T get() { return t; }
}

// This would not be allowed
Box<Integer>[] arrayOfBoxes = new Box<Integer>[10]; 

// If it were allowed, you could do the following:
Object[] objectArray = arrayOfBoxes; // Box<Integer>[] is a subtype of Object[]
objectArray[0] = new Box<String>(); // This should not be allowed
Integer number = arrayOfBoxes[0].get(); // This would throw a ClassCastException
```

continue from your last answer, so what if we put a box of String into the arraylist? You add the element into the array `elements` of objects? When does it check for error?

GitHub Copilot: When you add an element to an `ArrayList`, the type checking is done at compile time. This is because generics in Java are a compile-time concept. The type parameter `T` is used to enforce type safety at compile time.

Here's an example:

```java
ArrayList<Box<Integer>> listOfBoxes = new ArrayList<>();
listOfBoxes.add(new Box<Integer>()); // This is allowed
listOfBoxes.add(new Box<String>()); // Compile-time error
```

In this code, `listOfBoxes` is an `ArrayList` where each element is a `Box<Integer>`. When you try to add a `Box<String>` to `listOfBoxes`, you get a compile-time error. This is because the type of elements that can be added to the `ArrayList` is controlled at compile time.

When you retrieve an element from the `ArrayList`, it's cast to the parameterized type `T`. This cast is safe because the type of elements that can be added to the `ArrayList` is controlled at compile time.

```java
Box<Integer> box = listOfBoxes.get(0); // This is allowed
Box<String> anotherBox = listOfBoxes.get(0); // Compile-time error
```

In this code, you can retrieve an element from `listOfBoxes` and assign it to a `Box<Integer>`, but you cannot assign it to a `Box<String>`. This is because the type of elements that can be retrieved from the `ArrayList` is controlled at compile time.

Next, you might want to explore the actual source code of the `ArrayList` class to see how it works in more detail, or perhaps learn about other ways to work with collections of parameterized types in Java.

cydavidh: in your simplified version of arraylist 
```
public class ArrayList<T> {
    private Object[] elements;

    public ArrayList() {
        elements = new Object[10]; // Initial capacity
    }

    public void add(T t) {
        // Add the element as an Object
        elements[size] = t;
        size++;
    }

    public T get(int index) {
        // Retrieve the element and cast it to T
        return (T) elements[index];
    }
}
```
I don't see how arraylist checks for type of the element added to the array of objects `elements`

GitHub Copilot: The type checking in `ArrayList` is done at compile time due to the use of generics. When you declare an `ArrayList<T>`, you're telling the compiler that this list will only accept objects of type `T`. If you try to add an object of a different type, the compiler will give you an error.

Here's an example:

```java
ArrayList<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
strings.add("Hello"); // This is fine
strings.add(123); // This will give a compile-time error
```

In this code, `strings` is an `ArrayList<String>`, so it can only contain `String` objects. If you try to add an `Integer` to `strings`, the compiler will give you an error.

The `add(T t)` method in `ArrayList` accepts an argument of type `T`, which is the same type parameter that you used when you declared the `ArrayList`. This is how the `ArrayList` class ensures that you can only add objects of the correct type.

When you retrieve an object from the `ArrayList` with the `get(int index)` method, it returns the object as type `T`. This is safe because the `ArrayList` only allows objects of type `T` to be added.

Next, you might want to explore the actual source code of the `ArrayList` class to see how it works in more detail, or perhaps learn about other ways to work with collections of parameterized types in Java.
