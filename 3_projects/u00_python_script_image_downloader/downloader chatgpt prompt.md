I want you to create a python script that will read a txt file for a list of URL, seperated by a new line, for a website and download the picture in a specific element of class "yesPopunder image_perma_img inner_rounded" for each of the URL.
For example:
<img class="yesPopunder image_perma_img inner_rounded" src="https://i.imgur.com/VjN4npQ.jpeg" title="#teens" alt="#teens" style="cursor:hand;;width:620px;height:1103px;">

The input will be like:
example1.com/asdf
example1.com/qwer
