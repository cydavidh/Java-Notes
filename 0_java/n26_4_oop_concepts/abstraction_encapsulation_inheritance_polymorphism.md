OOP 4 concepts
Abstraction:
hide unnecessary detail and only show needed information
abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding but not eliminating the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.

Encapsulation
practice of keeping fields within a class private,

Inheritance
create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes

Polymorphism
Allows programmers to use the same word in Java to mean different things in different contexts. One form of polymorphism is method overloading. That’s when the code itself implies different meanings. 
The other form is method overriding. That’s when the values of the supplied variables imply different meanings.
