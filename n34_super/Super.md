Superclass

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private String phone;

    public Person(String name, String address) {}

    public void addPhone(int phone) {
        this.phone = phone;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {}
}
```

```java
public class Student extends Person {
    private int credits;

    public Student(String name, String address, int phone) {
        super(name, address);
        super.addPhone(phone); // remember super.method(), too!
        this.credits = 0;
    }

    public int credits() {return this.credits;}

//If a method or variable has the access modifier private, it is visible only to the internal methods of that class. Subclasses will not see it, and a subclass has no direct means to access it. 

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        //super.name: The field Person.name is not visible
        return super.toString() + this.credits;
    }
}
```

A subclass sees everything that is defined with the "public" modifier in the superclass. If we want to define some variables or methods that are visible to the subclasses but invisible to everything else, we can use the access modifier "protected" to achieve this.
