ConcurrentHashMap does more than just allow multiple threads to access the map simultaneously. It provides a set of guarantees to manage state in a multithreaded environment:

**Thread-Safety**: ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe, meaning multiple threads can operate on this map concurrently without the need for external synchronization.
**High Concurrency**: ConcurrentHashMap allows concurrent reads and a high level of concurrency for writes. This is achieved by segmenting the map into different parts and locking only a portion of the map during write operations.
**Visibility**: Changes made by one thread are visible to all other threads. For instance, if one thread puts an item in the map, other threads can see that item (assuming they are looking at the right key).
**No ConcurrentModificationException**: Iterators of ConcurrentHashMap do not throw ConcurrentModificationException, even if the map is modified while iterating.
However, it’s important to note that while ConcurrentHashMap provides a significant level of thread-safety and visibility, it does not provide a strong guarantee of immediate visibility of changes to the map for iterators created prior to the change. This is a trade-off for achieving better performance in a multithreaded environment. In many concurrent applications, these guarantees are sufficient. It’s always important to understand these nuances when working with concurrent collections in Java.
