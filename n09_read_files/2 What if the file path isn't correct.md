GitHub Copilot: The `Paths.get()` method takes a string representing the path to the file. If the path you provided doesn't work, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: If you're using a relative path, it's relative to the current working directory (which is usually the directory where you started your application). If your file isn't located there, you'll need to provide the correct relative path or use an absolute path. An absolute path starts from the root directory and specifies the exact location of a file or directory in the file system.

2. **Incorrect Path**: Ensure that the path is correct and the file exists at that location. You can check this manually by navigating through your file system.

3. **File Permissions**: Ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to access the file.

To debug, you can print the current working directory to see where your application is looking for the file:

```java
System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
```

This will print the current working directory. If your file is not in this directory, you'll need to provide the correct path to the `Paths.get()` method.

For example, if your file is in a subdirectory called `files`, you would access it like this:

```java
Files.lines(Paths.get("files/file.txt")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

Or if it's in the same directory as the .java file:

```java
Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

If none of these work, you might need to use an absolute path, which could look something like this:

```java
Files.lines(Paths.get("/Users/username/Documents/file.txt")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

Remember to replace `/Users/username/Documents/file.txt` with the actual path to your file.

Paths.get("n09_read_files/file.txt") // works
Paths.get("./n09_read_files/file.txt") // works
Paths.get("/n09_read_files/file.txt") // won't work
