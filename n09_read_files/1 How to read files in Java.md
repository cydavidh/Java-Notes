There are several ways to read a file in Java. Here are a few examples:

1. **Using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`**:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, `BufferedReader` reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.






2. **Using `Scanner` class**:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("file.txt"));
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
            }
            scanner.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
The `Scanner` class is a simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions.






3. **Using `Files` class from Java NIO**:

```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt")).forEach(System.out::println);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `Files.lines(Path)` method read all lines from a file as a Stream. Each line is then printed to the console.

Remember to handle exceptions properly in your code. In these examples, we simply print the stack trace of any exceptions that are thrown, but in a real-world application, you would likely want to handle these exceptions more gracefully.

When you call `Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt"))`, it returns a `Stream<String>`. The `Stream` interface in Java has a `forEach()` method, which allows you to perform an action for each element of the stream.

Here's an example:

```java
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("one", "two", "three");
stream.forEach(System.out::println);
```

This will print:

```
one
two
three
```

In the case of `Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt")).forEach(System.out::println);`, `Files.lines(Paths.get("file.txt"))` returns a `Stream<String>` where each element is a line from the file. `forEach(System.out::println)` then prints each line.






# The `forEach()` method is indeed a part of the Streams API in Java, but it's not exclusive to it. The `forEach()` method is also a part of the `Iterable` interface, which is implemented by the `Collection` interface. This means that any class that implements `Iterable` (which includes all collection classes like `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, etc.) will have the `forEach()` method.
