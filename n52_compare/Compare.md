Integer.compare()
Then, Integer.compare(sum1, sum2) is used to compare the sums. This method returns a negative integer if sum1 is less than sum2, zero if they're equal, and a positive integer if sum1 is greater than sum2.


GitHub Copilot: There are several methods in Java that you can use to compare two values, similar to `Integer.compare()`. Here are a few examples:

1. `Double.compare(double d1, double d2)`: Compares two `double` values in the same way as `Integer.compare()`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

2. `Float.compare(float f1, float f2)`: Compares two `float` values in the same way as `Integer.compare()`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

3. `Long.compare(long l1, long l2)`: Compares two `long` values in the same way as `Integer.compare()`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

4. `Short.compare(short s1, short s2)`: Compares two `short` values in the same way as `Integer.compare()`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

5. `Byte.compare(byte b1, byte b2)`: Compares two `byte` values in the same way as `Integer.compare()`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

6. `Character.compare(char c1, char c2)`: Compares two `char` values in the same way as `Integer.compare()`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

7. `Boolean.compare(boolean b1, boolean b2)`: Compares two `boolean` values. Returns zero if `b1` equals `b2`; a positive value if `b1` is `true` and `b2` is `false`; and a negative value if `b1` is `false` and `b2` is `true`.

8. `String.compareTo(String anotherString)`: Compares two strings lexicographically. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second string.

9. `Date.compareTo(Date anotherDate)`: Compares two dates for ordering. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first date is before, equal to, or after the second date.

10. `BigDecimal.compareTo(BigDecimal val)`: Compares this `BigDecimal` with the specified `BigDecimal`. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this `BigDecimal` is less than, equal to, or greater than `val`.

Remember, the specific method you should use depends on the types of the values you're comparing.
