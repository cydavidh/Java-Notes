When you pass by value,
you pass a copy of a reference variable,
but the copy points to the same object,
so modifying the copy effects the very same object that the original reference points to.

This is a problem when encapsulating.

3 ways to fix:
1. make reference variable field immutable (String is already immutable.)
2. defensive copy
3. encapsulate change within the encapsulating class (making encapsulation work as it should've)
- **Goal:** encapsulate the logic for changing the address within the Employee class.
- **Method:** eliminate direct access to Address object from outside the Employee class and provide method within Employee class to modify address.
=========================================================================================
private variables cannot be reassigned outside of class.
but the object is mutable
if we return the object.
then they can just do object.add("hurrdurr");
so we prevent the change by either
1. making the object immutable.
2. return a copy of the object instead of the actual object.
3. encapsulate change within encapsulating class (for example make the getter not return the object and create a add() method in the mother class that does the same thing as object.add) 
example: in Fix C we make the getter return immutable String street of the address, and we create a updateAddress method within Employee class. All modifications are channeled through controlled methods of the Employee class, effectively encapsulating the address change logic.

Exhibit A
```java
class Special {
    private StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("bob");

    StringBuilder getName() {
        return s;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Special sp = new Special();
        StringBuilder s2 = sp.getName();
        s2.append("sam");
        sout(s2) // "bobsam"
        sout(sp.getName()); //the private StringBuilder s is now also "bobsam"!
    }
}
```
Fix A: Defensive Copy
```java
class Special {
    private StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("bob");

    StringBuilder getName() {
        return new StringBuilder(s);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Special sp = new Special();
        StringBuilder s2 = sp.getName();
        s2.append("sam"); // "bobsam"
        sout(sp.getName()); // still "bob"
    }
}
```

Exhibit B
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class FunActivities {
    private List<String> activities;

    public FunActivities() {
        activities = new ArrayList<>();
        activities.add("Hiking");
        activities.add("Swimming");
    }

    public List<String> getActivities() {
        return activities;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FunActivities fa = new FunActivities();
        List<String> activitiesList = fa.getActivities();
        activitiesList.add("Dancing"); 
        System.out.println(activitiesList);     // ["Hiking", "Swimming", "Dancing"]
        System.out.println(fa.getActivities()); // ["Hiking", "Swimming", "Dancing"]
    }
}
```
Fix B: Defensive Copy
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class FunActivities {
    private List<String> activities;

    public FunActivities() {
        activities = new ArrayList<>();
        activities.add("Hiking");
        activities.add("Swimming");
    }

    public List<String> getActivities() {
        return new ArrayList<>(activities); // Defensive copy
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FunActivities fa = new FunActivities();
        List<String> activitiesList = fa.getActivities();
        activitiesList.add("Dancing"); 
        System.out.println(activitiesList);     // ["Hiking", "Swimming", "Dancing"]
        System.out.println(fa.getActivities()); // ["Hiking", "Swimming"]
                                                // proving the internal list is unaffected
    }
}
```
Fix B: Encapsulate Change
instead of being able to access the ArrayList and change it directly like Exhibit B, we add a method in FunActivities (addActivity) to change it. This way we prevent direct access.
```java
class FunActivities {
    private ArrayList<String> activities;

    public FunActivities() {
        this.activities = new ArrayList<>();
        activities.add("Cycling");
        activities.add("Hiking");
    }

    // Method to get all activities as an unmodifiable list
    public List<String> getAllActivities() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(activities);
    }

    // Method to add an activity
    public void addActivity(String activity) {
        activities.add(activity);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FunActivities fun = new FunActivities();
        fun.addActivity("Swimming");
        System.out.println(fun.getAllActivities()); // Includes "Swimming"
    }
}
```
Fix B: Make Object Immutable
```java
class FunActivities {
    private final List<String> activities;

    public FunActivities() {
        ArrayList<String> tempActivities = new ArrayList<>();
        tempActivities.add("Cycling");
        tempActivities.add("Hiking");
        this.activities = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList<>(tempActivities));
    }

    public List<String> getActivities() {
        return activities;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FunActivities fun = new FunActivities();
        List<String> myActivities = fun.getActivities();
        System.out.println(myActivities); // "Cycling", "Hiking"
        myActivities.add("Running"); // Attempting to modify myActivities will throw an UnsupportedOperationException
    }
}
```

Exhibit C
```java
class Employee {
    private Address address;

    Employee(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    Address getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }
}

class Address {
    private String street;

    Address(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }

    String getStreet() {
        return street;
    }

    void setStreet(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address address = new Address("123 Maple Street");
        Employee employee = new Employee(address);
        employee.getAddress().setStreet("999 Hollywood Boulevard");
        sout(address.getStreet()); //999 Hollywood Boulevard
        sout(employee.getAddress().getStreet()); //999 Hollywood Boulevard
    }
}
```
Fix C: Defensive Copy
```java
class Employee {
    private Address address;

    // Constructor makes a defensive copy of the address
    Employee(Address address) {
        this.address = new Address(address.getStreet());
    }

    // Returns a defensive copy of the address
    Address getAddress() {
        return new Address(address.getStreet());
    }

    // Set address with a defensive copy
    void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = new Address(address.getStreet());
    }
}

class Address {
    private String street;

    Address(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }

    String getStreet() {
        return street;
    }

    void setStreet(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address address = new Address("123 Main St");
        Employee employee = new Employee(address);
        employee.setAddress(new Address("999 Hollywood Bd"));
        sout(address.getStreet()); //address still 123 Main St
        sout(employee.getAddress().getStreet()); //employee address is 999 Hollywood Bd
    }
}
```
Fix C: Encapsulating Change: 
**Goal:** encapsulate the logic for changing the address within the Employee class.
**Method:** eliminate direct access to Address object from outside the Employee class and provide method within Employee class to modify address.
```java
class Employee {
    private Address address;

    Employee(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    // Direct access to the Address object is removed. Instead, provide a method to access specific information.
    String getAddress() {
        return address.getStreet();
    }

    // Encapsulates the address change. This method allows updating the street of the employee's address.
    void changeAddress(String street) {
        this.address.setStreet(street);
    }
}

class Address {
    private String street;

    Address(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }

    String getStreet() {
        return street;
    }

    // This setter is still present, but its direct use is discouraged in favor of encapsulation through the Employee class.
    void setStreet(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address address = new Address("123 Main St");
        Employee employee = new Employee(address);
        employee.changeAddress("999 Hollywood Bd");
        sout(address.getStreet()); //123 Main St
        sout(employee.getAddress().getStreet()); //999 Hollywood Bd
    }
}
```
