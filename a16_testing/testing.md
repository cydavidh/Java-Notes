# Test Driven Development

1. Write Test
2. Run test. Must fail. If pass, bad.
3. Write function to fulfill test requirement only.
4. Run test. If fail, fix function.
5. Refactor.

//(Refactoring means cleaning the code while maintaining the functionality of the program. Cleaning includes tasks such as improving the readibility and dividing the program into smaller methods and classes)
