cydavidh: introduce me to sort of collections

GitHub Copilot: In Java, the `Collections` class provides several methods for manipulating collections. One of these methods is `sort()`, which is used to sort the elements of a list in ascending order.

Here's the pseudocode for using `Collections.sort()`:

```
1. Create a list of elements
2. Use Collections.sort() to sort the list
3. (Optional) Print the sorted list
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(5);
numbers.add(2);
numbers.add(8);
numbers.add(1);

Collections.sort(numbers);

System.out.println(numbers); // Outputs: [1, 2, 5, 8]
```

In the above code, we first create an `ArrayList` of integers. We then add some numbers to the list. After that, we use `Collections.sort()` to sort the numbers in ascending order. Finally, we print out the sorted list.

Next, you might want to try sorting a list of strings, or perhaps explore other methods provided by the `Collections` class.

cydavidh: and if it's a class we create, we can implement comparable interfece and compareTo method, this way we can use .sort, right?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. If you have a custom class and you want to sort its instances, you can have the class implement the `Comparable` interface and override the `compareTo()` method. This method defines the "natural ordering" of the objects.

Here's the pseudocode:

```
1. Define a custom class that implements the Comparable interface
2. Override the compareTo() method in the custom class
3. Create a list of instances of the custom class
4. Use Collections.sort() to sort the list
5. (Optional) Print the sorted list
```

And here's the Java code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.name;
    }
}

ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
people.add(new Person("Charlie"));
people.add(new Person("Alice"));
people.add(new Person("Bob"));

Collections.sort(people);

System.out.println(people); // Outputs: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
```

In the above code, we define a `Person` class that implements `Comparable<Person>`. In the `compareTo()` method, we compare the `name` of the current `Person` with the `name` of another `Person`. We then create a list of `Person` objects and sort them using `Collections.sort()`. Finally, we print out the sorted list.

Next, you might want to try sorting on different properties of the `Person` class, or perhaps create a different custom class and sort its instances.
