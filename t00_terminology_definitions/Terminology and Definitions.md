class is blueprint. 
type equals class.
objecct is house. instance of a class


you define (create) a class
you instantiate a class with the new keyword. creating a new instance (object) of the Car class
    Car myCar = new Car();

you declare an object
    Object object;
you initialize an object
```java
public class Car {
private String color;

public Car() {
    color = "Red"; // Initializing the color of the car
}
}
```
for `int i = 0` you declare variable i of type int, and you initialize with initial value of 0;
there is no instantiation because int is a primitive type in Java, not an object.


instance variable
    private String;

instance method
    public String getName();

static method
    public static int calculateShit();
