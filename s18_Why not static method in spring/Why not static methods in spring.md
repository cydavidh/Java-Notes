1. Static Methods Belong to the Class, Not Instances: In Java, a static method belongs to the class itself, not to instances (objects) of the class. This means you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.

2. Spring Focuses on Instances (Beans): Spring Framework is built around managing instances of classes, known as beans. These beans are created and managed by Spring's container, which handles their entire lifecycle, including creating instances, injecting dependencies, and more.

3. Dependency Injection: One of the core features of Spring is dependency injection, where Spring automatically provides a class with the instances of other classes it depends on (its dependencies). This is done through instance methods and fields, not static methods.

4. Why Not Static Methods in Spring:

- No State Management: Static methods can't access instance variables (non-static fields) directly. They operate independently of any object state, which goes against the idea of managing stateful beans in Spring.
- No Dependency Injection: You can't inject dependencies into static methods as you can with instance methods. Dependency injection is a key feature of Spring, allowing for more flexible and testable code.
- Less Flexibility: Using static methods ties your code to specific implementations, making it harder to change or configure behavior dynamically, which is something Spring aims to simplify.

5. Simple Example:
Imagine you have a `Calculator` class. If you make all methods static, you can call them without creating a `Calculator` object, like `Calculator.add(5, 3)`.
But if you want to remember the last result, or if you want to configure the calculator (like setting a mode or precision), static methods won't help. You'd need an instance of `Calculator` to hold this state or configuration, and that's where Spring and its dependency injection shine.


In summary, static methods are more about providing utility functions that are stateless and independent of any object's lifecycle. Spring, however, is designed to manage stateful beans with flexible configurations and dependencies, which aligns better with instance methods.
