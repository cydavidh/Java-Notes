Declaration of a variable in a computer programming language is a statement used to specify the variable name and its data type. 
Declaration tells the compiler about the existence of an entity in the program and its location. 
When you declare a variable, you should also initialize it.

Initialization is the process of assigning a value to the Variable. 
Every programming language has its own method of initializing the variable. 
If the value is not assigned to the Variable, then the process is only called a Declaration.
